  <p style="text-align: left;">Some more thoughts from The Political Revolution PAC:</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Campaigning</strong> for public office is time consuming and can be expensive. If
    you have a family, consider how running for office will affect them and others in your life. Public office may also
    put them in the spotlight and may decrease your available family time at home.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fundraising</strong> can help you build financial backing but it is important to
    understand your financial situation before you declare a run for office.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">You will be in the public eye, both during your campaign and while in office. You must
    uphold the highest civic and moral standards for yourself and understand that you will be acting on behalf of your
    entire community, should you win. Think hard about how you will conduct yourself, and make sure you have thought
    through the issues and your positions.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What is your background</strong>? Education, experience and occupation all play a
    critical role in running for office. You do not need a Political Science degree from Harvard to run, but voters will
    look at your background and education when they are deciding whom to vote for.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Carefully consider the position &#8211; </strong>What is important to you, what
    issues are you passionate about and what do you think that you can do differently to make a positive change? If you
    are involved with the local PTA and are passionate about local school issues, you should probably look into running
    for the local school board rather than city council. If you have a prominent career, you may be hold up to scrutiny
    that higher office involves, like Mayor or Congressperson.<br />
    What type of expertise should someone in that position have? Do you have it?</p>
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">Whoever you are and wherever you go, be good above all else&#8230;</h5>
