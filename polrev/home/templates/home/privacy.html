<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="padding: 50px;"><br />
      The Political Revolution has created this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and disclose
      information that you may provide while visiting our website, mobile sites, mobile applications and other online
      services (the “Sites”) using a personal computer, mobile device, or any other means, and to demonstrate our firm
      commitment to Internet privacy. This Policy also applies to personal information collected by third-party vendors
      on our behalf. The Political Revolution operates in the United States and the information we collect is governed
      by U.S. law.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Political Revolution may modify this Policy from time to time so we encourage you
    to check this page when revisiting the Sites to make sure that you are informed of how your personal information
    will be used. We will post notice of any changes by revising the date last updated on the Policy. By using or
    accessing the Sites, you accept the Policy and its terms and conditions in effect at that time.</span></p>
<p><h3>What is Personal Information?</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personal Information” is information about a particular individual that specifically
    identifies that individual, or information about that individual, such as name, address, email address, telephone
    number, or credit or debit card information. Personal Information does not include “aggregate information,” which is
    data we may collect automatically about the use of the Sites. The Policy does not restrict The Political
    Revolution’s collection and use of aggregate information.</span></p>
<p><h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect Personal Information that you provide to us when you register, send us an
    email, sign up to receive email or text messages, sign up to volunteer, fill out a form, make a purchase or
    donation, communicate with us through third-party social feeds, request information, participate in active forums or
    take any other action on the Sites. As required by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), we must also collect and
    disclose the name, address, occupation, and employer of all donors whose donations exceed $200 during the election
    cycle. We may also obtain information from outside sources and combine it with the information we collect through
    the Sites. We will never knowingly collect, use or disclose Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13,
    consistent with the United States Federal Children’s Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPPA). If you have any
    reservations, questions or concerns about your child’s access to the Sites or how information that your child
    provides is used by us, please contact us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may automatically collect information when you visit the Sites such as the
    Internet Protocol (IP) address, the browser and operating system you use, the name of the domain and host from which
    you access the Internet, the address of the website from which you linked to the Sites, device identifiers and
    mobile and network information, and your actions on the Sites. This information will be treated as Personal
    Information if we combine or link it to any of the identifying information above. Otherwise, this information
    constitutes aggregate information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also automatically receive and store certain types of information when you
    visit the Sites through the use of cookies, web beacons, or similar programs to collect the information described
    above. Cookies are small text files stored locally on your computer that help store user preferences. “Web beacons”
    are small pieces of code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views,
    promotion views, or advertising responses. We may use cookies or web beacons to measure aggregate web statistics,
    including the number of monthly visitors, number of repeat visitors, most popular webpages and other information. We
    will also use cookies to facilitate your online visit by maintaining data that you provide so that you will not need
    to resubmit certain information. Cookies do not contain any Personal Information and we will never track your
    Internet usage outside of the Sites. In many web browsers, you can choose to delete, disable, turn off, or reject
    most cookies and web beacons through the “Internet Options” sub-option of the “Tools” menu of your web browser or
    otherwise as directed by your web browser’s support feature. Please consult the “Help” section of your web browser
    for more information. Our web servers may also collect “log data.” Log data provides aggregate information about the
    number of visits to different pages on the Sites. We use log data for troubleshooting purposes and to track which
    pages people visit in order to improve the Sites. We do not link log data collected to Personal Information.
    Third-party vendors may also collect aggregate log data independently from us.</span></p>
<p><h3>Collection from Other Sources</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Policy also applies to Personal Information that we may obtain from third-party
    vendors such as search engines or social media sites. However, we are not responsible for the content or privacy
    policies of these third-party vendors. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and review the practices of all
    websites you visit.</span></p>

<p><h3>How We Share Your Personal Information</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may share Personal
    information as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we have a good-faith belief that release is appropriate to comply with the
      law (for example, a lawful subpoena);</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect the rights or property or safety of our supporters, employees,
      volunteers or others; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With vendors, service providers, consultants,
      employees, contractors, or volunteers who need to know such information to carry out their duties;</span></li>
  <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">With groups, causes, organizations, or candidates we believe have similar
        views, goals, and principles; </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">To report your name, address,

<p><h3>How We Protect the Information You Provide</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Political Revolution uses reasonable industry-standard security measures to
    protect against the loss, misuse, theft, unauthorized access, destruction or alteration of the information under our
    control. Our server is located in a locked, secure environment. Although we make good faith efforts to store
    information collected by the Sites in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.</span>
</p>
<p><h3>Petitions</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any petitions that you have signed online, and any comments therewith, constitute
    public information that we may provide to local, state, or national political leaders and the press.</span></p>
<p><strong>Advertising and Analytics Services</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may communicate with third-party vendors, including Google, and place online
    advertising, which will be shown on other websites on the Internet. In some cases, those third-party vendors may
    decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the Sites. At no time will you be personally identified
    to those third-party vendors, nor will any of the information you share with us be shared with those third-party
    vendors. If you prefer to opt out of the use of these third-party cookies on the Sites, you can do so by visiting
    the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us
    understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with the Sites. We may also use embedded images in emails
    to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to our supporters.</span></p>
<p><h3>California Residents</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when
    turned on, send a signal or preference to a website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user
    does not wish to be tracked. California law requires that an operator of a website or other online service disclose
    how the operator responds to a Do Not Track signal and whether third parties may collect personal information about
    an individual’s online activities from the operator’s website or online service. The Political Revolution is
    committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected through the Sites, however please
    be aware that the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and
    solutions, and therefore the Sites may or may not respond to those signals. California law also provides California
    residents with the right to receive disclosures about any sharing of their Personal Information to a business in
    connection with a business relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and if that
    business has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such an individual’s Personal Information to a
    third-party and knows or should have known that such third-party used the information for its own direct marketing
    purposes, then that business is obligated to disclose in writing to such individual upon request, what Personal
    Information was shared and with whom it was shared. Any request for a disclosure required under this California law
    should be sent to us via email at info@pol-rev.com or via regular mail at <strong>The Political
      Revolution, PO Box 930539 Wixom, MI 48393.</strong></span></p>
<p><h3>How to Unsubscribe or Opt Out</h3></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who subscribe to email lists via the Sites will receive periodic updates from
    us by regular mail, fax or email. You may opt out of receiving future information via email by using the unsubscribe
    procedure specified on the email message.</span></p>
<p><h3>How to Contact Us</h3></p>
